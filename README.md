# README  

This is a small blog site I created with the tutorial: https://medium.com/@deallen7/ruby-on-rails-app-build-blog-3d9975a999ae  
  
This is my first ruby on rails project; a language I have been interested in learning for some time.  
I am upskilling and learning this language myself in my spare time, to hopefully transition into in the future.  
  
During this project, I have also setup my first CI/CD. This is using Codeship & Heroku, continuously deploying a successful master branch build to production (no other pipelines as this is using the free/hobby tiers).  
  
This is available on my website jamielafferty.co.uk  
This will become my living CV.
